MT940/MT942 is a text based data file format used in bank account statements
(commonly used by banks in the Netherlands). A bank account statement contains
your account balance as well as a listing of all the transactions between a
given start date and end date.

This library provides an API to define and serialize MT940/MT942 documents in
Python. It does not provide a parser.
